# Character window
Each character has a dedicated window. This window is used to consult all the elements of this character. A subset of theses elements are editable.

From the main window, double click on the row of the character to use. This will bring the main window for this character. This is the window we present here.
From this window, you will perform all the actions for this character:
- edit main characteristics
- edit the character configurations
- consult or edit a lot of specific aspects of the character

## Main characteristics edition
The 'Edit...' button brings a window where you can edit the main characteristics of this character:
    - name (you may change the name of your character if ever it changes in game)
    - server (you may change the server if your relocate your character to another server)
    - sex
    - region
    - class
    - race
    - level

## Character configurations
In this window, we have a table of 'configurations'. Each configuration contains the real or simulated configuration of your character at a given date.

When the character is created, a 'character configuration' is created for it, that reflects the state of a new character (level 1) for this race and class.

When a character is imported from the game client (with 'Current Gear' ticked), a new 'character configuration' is created for it, that reflects the current state of the character in the game (level, gear, virtues...).

A detailed presentation of the 'Character Configuration' window is available [HERE](../CharacterConfigurationEdition/CharacterConfigurationEdition.md).
